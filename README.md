# Project-Linux-Infrastructure-Automation-with-Ansible
I created a Linux automation lab using Ansible on VirtualBox with a Fedora control node and Ubuntu/Fedora clients. Through SSH key-based access and a custom inventory, I automated tasks like system checks and web server installations. This project showcases practical DevOps automation across multi-platform environments.
